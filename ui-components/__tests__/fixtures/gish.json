The nature, severity and recency of such offenses and/or ongoing criminal activity will be considered when reviewing the Applicant and only those potentially impacting the health, safety, security or right to peaceful enjoyment of the property of and by other residents, visitors or employees will be considered.\n\nAdditionally, applicants may be rejected due to:\n\n* A history of violence or abuse (physical or verbal), in which the applicant was determined to be the antagonist.\n* A household in which any member is currently engaged in illegal use of drugs or for which the owner has reasonable cause to believe that a member’s illegal use or pattern of use of a drug may interfere with the health, safety, security, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the property of and by other residents, visitors or employees.\n* Any member, if there is reasonable cause to believe that a member’s behavior, from abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol, may interfere with the health, safety, security or right to peaceful enjoyment of the property of and by other residents, visitors or employees.",
